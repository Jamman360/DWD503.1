                        Originally discovered by Polynesian seafarers between 1280 and 1350, 
                        and later by the famous Abel Tasman in 1642, New Zealand was the last 
                        large habitable land mass to be settled. almost 200 years later, history 
                        was made when The British Empire signed a treaty with the Maori Chiefs. 
                        This made New Zealand a colony under British sovereignty, later gaining 
                        independence in 1907, with the British Monarch as Head of State.

                        The Treaty of Waitangi was a document drafted by representatives of the 
                        british settlers, and translated into Maori to be circulated around 
                        different Maori settlements around the North Island. The Translation at 
                        the time was the best they could manage, but there were several parts 
                        where the Maori translation was not the most accurate, and caused issues 
                        later on down the line.<br><br> One thing the treaty allowed the settlers to do 
                        was to purchase land from the Maori People, and while this was honored 
                        some of the time, there were equal if not more instances of unfair deals, 
                        occupation without sale of land, or even outright confiscations after the
                        New Zealand Wars around 1850, where the Government held the Treaty in 
                        complete disregard.<br><br>Only around 1950, as Maori increasingly began to use 
                        the Treaty as a platform to reclaim land and rights, did the Government 
                        begin to listen to them, and start to bring the Treaty into a more central
                        place in NZ Law. 1975 brought around the Treaty of Waitangi Act, 
                        establishing a Waitangi Tribunal to handle all related inquiries and advise 
                        the Government on actions to take that keeps the Treaty in mind.

                        With a plethora of historical mining sites around the country, Mining 
                        has been a large part of our culture. New Zealand ranks among the top 30 
                        countries for Iron and Gold ore production, and the mining sector alone 
                        in 2017 contributed to 1.3% of the GDP that year. There have been 3 major 
                        Gold Rushes - One in Coromandel in 1852, and the Otago and West 
                        Coast Rushes both in the 1860s. Mining techniques evolved over the years, 
                        from panning gold to dredging and using Stamper Batteries to get gold 
                        out of quartz veins. Relatively recently there has been opposition to 
                        proposals to restart mining in the Coromandel Peninsula, where one of 
                        our Countries' largest gold deposits is.
